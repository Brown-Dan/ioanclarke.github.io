<p>
Hi, my name is Ioan. I'm a software developer at Auto Trader. I have a Bachelor's in maths from University of Bristol and a Master's in computing MSc from Cardiff University.

<p>
The languages I'd say I'm half-decent at are Java (which is what we use at work), Python and Javascript. I'm also currently learning Kotlin, Haskell, Elm and Rust.
